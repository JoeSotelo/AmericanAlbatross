# AmericanAlbatross
A website designed for my interests. 

#1Welcome to my website, The American Albatross. 
This project is an expression of my creative energy and interests. Also, if you are able to read this line, 
then you are interested in my code. The notes here will be a step-by-step guide as I begin my journey in
Computer Science and Programming. 

Regards, Kujo.

#I want my website to open up my various workflows via linked sites, then position them on my computer in squares.
